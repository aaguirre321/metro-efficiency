# "Efficiency of the Tokyo Metro System: A Comparative Analysis" code repository 
## by Arely Aguirre, George Anders, Andrew Pham, and Haochen Yang.
For the Tokyo and Madrid metro systems, this code is used for data cleaning, calculation of important metro stations, node percolation, robustness analysis, and analysis of distances traveled on the metro compared to the geographical distance between two points.

The csv files regarding the Tokyo Metro System station adjacencies and station names can be found at https://github.com/Jugendhackt/tokyo-metro-data/tree/master.

The json file with station coordinates for the Tokyo Metro can be found at https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/stations.json.

The csv file regarding all necessary Madrid Metro data can be found at https://github.com/jvicentem/madrid_metro_adjacency_list/tree/master.
